## Implementation Notes

### server/routes/github.js
**Issue:** 1. Added express-validator to strictly validate all user inputs (owner, repo, branch, SHA, file path, PR title/body). 2. Centralized githubRequest helper to correctly attach Authorization header with user's token. 3. Added role-based auth guard to ensure req.user is present. 4. Used Buffer and base64 encoding for file content. 5. Sanitized PR title/body to avoid code injection.

**Security Notes:** Ensure auth middleware properly populates req.user.token and req.user.role. Limit roles for sensitive operations. Always validate and escape any user-controlled strings.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- express-validator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Send valid and invalid requests to each route to verify validation
- Test behavior when token is missing or invalid

---

### server/routes/github-security-bot.js
**Issue:** 1. Removed any dynamic eval or exec. 2. Stored bot token exclusively in env and never returned it. 3. Validated all inputs with express-validator. 4. Ensured SHA and file paths match safe patterns. 5. Base64 encode/decode handled safely. 6. Proper error forwarding to central handler.

**Security Notes:** Ensure process.env.GITHUB_BOT_TOKEN has minimum scope. Validate patch format or use a safe patch library for diffs.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- express-validator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test issue creation and auto-fix with valid and invalid data
- Verify no secrets leak in responses

---

### server/index.js
**Issue:** 1. Added helmet for common headers. 2. Set JSON body size limit. 3. Configured rate limiting. 4. Configured CORS with origin whitelist from env. 5. Mounted auth middleware on '/api' to protect all endpoints. 6. Centralized errorHandler at end.

**Security Notes:** Ensure CORS_WHITELIST is configured securely. Adjust rate limits to match usage.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- helmet
- express-rate-limit
- dotenv

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test allowed and disallowed origins
- Verify rate limit enforcement

---

### server/middleware/auth.js
**Issue:** 1. Reads API_KEYS from env and splits into an array. 2. Uses crypto.timingSafeEqual for constant-time comparison to prevent timing attacks. 3. Returns 401 if missing; 403 if invalid. 4. Attaches req.user for downstream usage if needed.

**Security Notes:** Rotate API_KEYS periodically. Consider using a vault or secret manager.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- crypto

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test with valid key
- Test with invalid or missing key
- Check timing to ensure no info leakage

---

### server/middleware/errorHandler.js
**Issue:** 1. Captures HTTP errors (e.g., from axios) and response code. 2. Logs stack trace on server only. 3. Sends generic message for 5xx errors to avoid leaking internals. 4. Returns actual error message for client errors (4xx).

**Security Notes:** Extend to handle different error types (JWT errors, validation errors) more granularly.

**Additional Dependencies:**
None

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Trigger 4xx and 5xx errors and verify responses
- Check logs for stack traces

---

### server/routes/vellum.js
**Issue:** 1. Added express-validator to enforce repo and owner naming conventions. 2. Ensured branch input optional and validated. 3. Secured Vellum API key usage via Authorization header. 4. Centralized error forwarding.

**Security Notes:** Ensure VELLUM_API_KEY has least privilege. Sanitize or truncate AI responses if displayed to users.

**Additional Dependencies:**
- express-validator

**Testing Recommendations:**
- Test analyze endpoint with valid and invalid data
- Simulate Vellum API errors to trigger errorHandler
